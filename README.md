# Speed-Detection
 Python project to detectt the speed and also to detect the number plate of the vehicles using yolo

 A speed detection project using Python involves analyzing video footage or images from a camera to detect and track moving objects, typically vehicles. The system calculates the speed of these objects by measuring distances traveled between frames and the time elapsed. Speed information can be displayed in real-time or logged for later analysis. Calibration, thresholding, optimization, testing, integration, and documentation are important aspects of the project. Key libraries used include OpenCV for computer vision and NumPy for numerical computations.

 IT helps in predicting the speed of the moving objects and can be if modified and upgraded to use on highways for challan.

 After running speed.py we get the output in the speed.txt file for the speed of the car related with their ids.
